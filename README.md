## FileDownloader2

Now, [FileDownloader2-OkDownload](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload) is released, okdownload will contain all advantage on the FileDownloader and beyond.

Because of FileDownloader unit-test coverage is very low, so all farther features and enhances will be achieved on the okdownload instead of FileDownloader, and FileDownloader will only focuses on bug fixes.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.goooler.android:filedownloader-fork:1.7.10'
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/), you can include on your gradle project through:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
}
```

## Open customize component

From now on, FileDownloader support following components to be customized by yourself:

| Name | Interface | Default Impl
| --- | --- | ---
| Connection | [FileDownloadConnection][FileDownloadConnection-java-link] | [FileDownloadUrlConnection][FileDownloadUrlConnection-java-link]
| OutputStream | [FileDownloadOutputStream][FileDownloadOutputStream-java-link] | [FileDownloadRandomAccessFile][FileDownloadRandomAccessFile-java-link]
| Database | [FileDownloadDatabase][FileDownloadDatabase-java-link] | [RemitDatabase][RemitDatabase-java-link]
| ConnectionCountAdapter | [ConnectionCountAdapter][ConnectionCountAdapter-java-link] | [DefaultConnectionCountAdapter][DefaultConnectionCountAdapter-java-link]
| IdGenerator | [IdGenerator][IdGenerator-java-link] | [DefaultIdGenerator][DefaultIdGenerator-java-link]
| ForegroundServiceConfig | [ForegroundServiceConfig][ForegroundServiceConfig-java-link] | [ForegroundServiceConfig][ForegroundServiceConfig-java-link]

> - If you want to use okhttp as your connection component, the simplest way is [this repo](https://github.com/Jacksgong/filedownloader-okhttp3-connection).
> - If you don't want to use any database on FileDownloader(the database on FileDownloader is used for persist tasks' breakpoint info) just using [NoDatabaseImpl.java](https://github.com/Goooler/FileDownloader/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/services/NoDatabaseImpl.java)

### How to valid it?

Just create your own `DownloadMgrInitialParams.InitCustomMaker` and put those customized component to it, finally init the FileDownloader with it: [FileDownloader#init](https://github.com/Goooler/FileDownloader/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/FileDownloader.java#L62)

## Adaptation

### Adapt to Android 8.0

The restriction of background service has been tightened since Android 8.0, for more details, please refer to [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background).
So, after Android 8.0, the download service will be a foreground service when start downloading during app is in background and you will see a notification with a title named "FileDownloader" start from FileDownloader 1.7.6.
You can refer to [here](https://github.com/Goooler/FileDownloader/wiki/Compatibility-of-Android-O-Service) to custom the notification.

### Adapt to Android 9.0

Starting with Android 9.0 (API level 28), cleartext support is disabled by default, you can have a look at [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45940861/android-8-cleartext-http-traffic-not-permitted) to know about more details.
FileDownloader demo has handled this problem start with 1.7.6.

According to the [migration notes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-migration#tya), the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission has been added to the library manifest since FileDownloader 1.7.6.

## Usage

By default, the FileDownloadService runs on the separate process, if you want to run it on the main process, just configure on the [filedownloader.properties](https://github.com/Goooler/FileDownloader/wiki/filedownloader.properties), and you can use `FileDownloadUtils.isDownloaderProcess(Context)` to check whether the FileDownloadService can run on the current process.
